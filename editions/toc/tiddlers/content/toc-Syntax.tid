The ''toc'' filter allows to specify a ''root'' element for your <<tw "Table-of-Contents Macros" "table of contents">> in the <<tw Filters filter>> ''operand'', as well as a range of options in the ''suffix'':

`toc:<suffix>[<operand>]`

Both suffix and operand are optional. The default root element is the value of `<<currentTiddler>>` or `TableOfContents` when undefined.

The ''toc'' filter supports the following suffixes that are declared as `name=<value>`, separated with spaces.

| !Suffix | !Description | !Default |
|''level''|the numeric level down to which the tree is calculated|`-1`<br>(none)|
|''exclude''|a variable defining a filter of elements to be excluded| |
|''truncate''|a variable defining a filter of elements to be truncated,<br>i.e. they are indexed but not further inspected for children| |
|''list''|the field defining the tree, i.e. a tagging tree|`tags`|
|''sort''|a field by which to sort the titles __for each level__ in ascending order<br>Â» prepend `!` to sort in descending order, e.g. `sort=!order`| |
